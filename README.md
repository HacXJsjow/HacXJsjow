So someone found an exploit in Netflix Germany which you could use to easily bypass verification when you used the payment method as "Direct Debit" and provided them with an IBAN number from France.

In order to exploit all of these and create as many accounts as I can, i wrote a simple python script.
Works on both linux and windows.

NOTE:
THIS WAS PATCHED on August 25th, 2020 [IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE :(]

[+] Dependencies:
Selenium ,Chrome webdriver ,Beautifulsoup4

[+] Usage:
python3 netflix.py
